#Description of project
This project is a budgeting/to-do helper tool. This will allow whoever to access their budgetting goals quickly and easily. Just bought a coffee? Subtract it from your weekly/monthly/etc budget for whatever category you decide! Need to remember to pay a bill? Jot it down in the to-do section and check it when you get home. This application will allow for students to keep all of their reminders and keep their tight student budget together in one convenient location.

#Technologies
C++, Qt, QML, Javascript, SQLite

#Screenshots/Mockups

#How to install
1. Install Qt 5.6 
2. Open project 
3. Clean all, run qmake, build all, run.

#Contribution guidelines
The application should be easy to navigate through. It should be a simple application to figure out and shouldn't make adding/removing items hard. The budget should be easy to view and understand.

#Bugs
Bugs in most applications like this consist of too much information on the screen. They're not a fast/easy/customizable way to handle your money. 

#Todo List
The first step is to create a homepage/splash screen. Simple outline with not a lot of fluff.

#Credits/Inspirations/Alternatives
I picked this project because I notice that between working and doing school, sometimes it's hard to tell how much money is spent on random purchases. Those little and random purchases can really hurt your pocket. Also when I'm in the middle of doing something I think of something I need to remember for later and don't want to forget, would be nice to jot it down.
