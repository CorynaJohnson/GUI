I created 2 classes. I have a budget class and a category class. They don't directly need to
interact with each other because they don't depend on each other's information. The budget
class will handle everything with calculating the budget left - it doesn't care what the
category is. The category just needs to know information about what you want within your
category. This may change over time but right now they are seperated and not dependent.

I expect the user to click through the options in the menu and have a keyboard input for
the names of categories and the dollar amounts. They should be able to go back and change
information entered.
